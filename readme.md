## Conclusion so far

- It is quite handy for some 'standard UI' e.g. setting, activity pages.

- However, for some complex UIs, it seems not(yet) a good choice. The reason is even the sample application (UIExplorer) is laggy for some parts like navigator, listview, gesture...[etc](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/performance.html) Thus, I will still compose complex UIs in native way,
